    <h1 class="home-title">DeFi (Decentralized Finance)</h1>
    <p class="justify-text">Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a groundbreaking alternative to traditional banking, offering financial services without intermediaries like banks or brokers. Built on blockchain technology, DeFi platforms use smart contracts to enable lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest in a permissionless and transparent manner. Unlike traditional finance, which requires credit checks and lengthy approvals, DeFi allows anyone with an internet connection to access financial tools using just a cryptocurrency wallet. This inclusivity has attracted millions of users, with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols reaching tens of billions of dollars, showcasing its rapid growth and adoption. One of the main reasons people are turning to DeFi is the promise of greater control over their assets. In traditional finance, institutions can freeze accounts, impose fees, or restrict access, whereas DeFi gives users full ownership of their funds. Additionally, DeFi often offers higher yields on savings and investments compared to conventional banks, thanks to innovative mechanisms like liquidity mining and yield farming. The transparency of blockchain also reduces fraud risks, as all transactions are publicly verifiable. For those in regions with unstable banking systems or hyperinflation, DeFi provides a secure and accessible way to preserve wealth and participate in global markets. Despite its advantages, DeFi is not without risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainties. However, the demand for decentralized financial systems continues to grow as people seek alternatives to centralized control and inefficiencies. The rise of self-custody wallets, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and blockchain-based insurance further strengthens DeFiâ€™s ecosystem. As technology improves and more users embrace financial sovereignty, DeFi is poised to redefine the future of money, making finance more open, efficient, and equitable for everyone.</p>
